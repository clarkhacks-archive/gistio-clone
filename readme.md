# gistio-clone
This is a github [gist](https://gist.github.com/) viewer which was inspired by
[gist.io](http://gist.io). I made it because I like gist.io but the source is in
python and it does not handle multiple files the way I expected it to. Check out
gist.io and also checkout [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) which inspired it.
